# Creating extensions on PBXs and calling each other using the extension created
### Dependencies
   Zoiper
- Log into the PBX with user credentials if you donâ€™t have any account one has to be created.
 - If you have a pbx account log in to the pbx and create extensions
#### Create  extensions.
- Click applications once done a drop down menu will appear . go to extensions and click.
- Click on quik create extensions and enter the details required like the following;
- Display name
 -Caller id
- Then click on next and finish.  Create Two extensions so that they can be used for establishing the connection.
##### Testing the extension by calling each other using the same extensions created
- Downloaded zoiper and registered the extensions on zoiper with credentials such as user name, password and domain.
- After that was done , we called the extension created and they rang without audio.
##### To enable audio after the calls were made.
- To enable audio, we created the sip-trunk which was used to establish communication between the two PBXs.
- After creating the  trunk we got the trunk's credentials and used it in the second pbx as the second PBXs sip-trunk.
- Then created the inbound and outbound routes for making the calls between the pbxs using the registered extensions. Additional information includes the following; trunk name, dial pattern and the inbound route.
- Clicked on settings > asterisk sip settings ,then click on detect network settings under NAT settings then click submit and apply config.
- Then click admin >asterisk CLI and a form appeared where we entered core restart now as a command and clicked on the send button. Wait for 10-20 minutes for it to execute the command and refresh the page.
- Then we did a test call and the audio worked.
